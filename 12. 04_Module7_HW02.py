# Task 1
# Develop an information system Employees. The app should provide data input, editing the employee’s data, deleting an employee, searching for an employee by last name, outputting information about all employees of the specified age or whose last name begins with the specified letter. Pro- vide the possibility to save the found information to a file. The full list of employees is also saved to a file (automatically when exiting the app, by the user’s command at runtime). The employee list is loaded from the file specified by the user when the app starts.
